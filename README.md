  ## What is fractals?
 
  Fractals are complex, self-similar geometric patterns that repeat themselves at different scales. In mathematics, fractals are objects that exhibit a similar pattern or structure on different scales or magnifications, and are often described as "infinitely complex." Fractals can be found in many natural phenomena, such as coastlines, clouds, trees, and mountains. They have also been used to model various systems, such as the behavior of financial markets, the spread of diseases, and the growth of populations. Fractal geometry has been used in many different fields, including art, architecture, computer graphics, and digital image compression. The study of fractals has also led to the development of new mathematical techniques and theories.

## What is complex numbers?

A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where "a" and "b" are real numbers and "i" is the imaginary unit, which is defined as the square root of -1. The real part of the complex number is "a" and the imaginary part is "b". Complex numbers are used extensively in mathematics, physics, and engineering, particularly in fields such as electrical engineering and control theory. They are also used in many other applications, including signal processing, quantum mechanics, and computer graphics. The operations on complex numbers include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and complex conjugation. Complex conjugation involves changing the sign of the imaginary part of a complex number. The absolute value of a complex number is also defined, which is the distance between the complex number and the origin in the complex plane.

## What is Mnadelbrot set?
The Mandelbrot set is a famous fractal that is generated by the iterative application of a simple function to complex numbers. It is named after the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, who first discovered it in the 1970s.

The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of all complex numbers "c" for which the sequence of numbers generated by the iteration of the function f(z) = z^2 + c remains bounded. In other words, if the sequence of numbers generated by repeatedly applying this function to an initial complex number "z" does not tend towards infinity, then "c" is considered to be a part of the Mandelbrot set.

The Mandelbrot set is typically visualized as a two-dimensional plot in the complex plane, where each point represents a complex number "c". The points that are a part of the Mandelbrot set are usually colored black, while the points that are not a part of the set are assigned a color based on how quickly they diverge towards infinity under the iterative application of the function.

The Mandelbrot set is a fascinating object, as it exhibits a high degree of self-similarity at different scales. This means that if you zoom into the boundary of the set, you will see intricate and detailed patterns that resemble the overall shape of the set. The Mandelbrot set has become a popular subject of study and exploration in mathematics, computer graphics, and art.

## What is Julia set?
 the Julia set is another famous fractal generated by the iterative application of a function to complex numbers. However, unlike the Mandelbrot set, the Julia set is generated by varying the initial complex number "z" rather than the constant "c" in the function.

The Julia set is defined as the set of all complex numbers "z" for which the sequence of numbers generated by the iteration of a given function remains bounded. The function used to generate the Julia set is usually of the form f(z) = z^2 + c, where "c" is a fixed complex number.

The Julia set is typically visualized as a two-dimensional plot in the complex plane, where each point represents an initial complex number "z". The points that are a part of the Julia set are usually colored black, while the points that are not a part of the set are assigned a color based on how quickly they diverge towards infinity under the iterative application of the function.

One interesting feature of the Julia set is that it can exhibit a wide range of different shapes and patterns depending on the value of "c" and the initial conditions. Some Julia sets have a fractal boundary, while others have a more regular shape. The Julia set has also been studied extensively in complex dynamics, as it exhibits a range of complex and chaotic behaviors.
