  ## What is fractals?
 
  Fractals are complex, self-similar geometric patterns that repeat themselves at different scales. In mathematics, fractals are objects that exhibit a similar pattern or structure on different scales or magnifications, and are often described as "infinitely complex." Fractals can be found in many natural phenomena, such as coastlines, clouds, trees, and mountains. They have also been used to model various systems, such as the behavior of financial markets, the spread of diseases, and the growth of populations. Fractal geometry has been used in many different fields, including art, architecture, computer graphics, and digital image compression. The study of fractals has also led to the development of new mathematical techniques and theories.
